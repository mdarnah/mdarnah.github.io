    <p class="intro">
  The evolution of web and application servers reflects the growing complexity and performance needs of the internet. The first web server, created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, only served static content. As websites evolved, the need for dynamic content emerged, leading to innovations like CGI (Common Gateway Interface) and server-side scripting.
</p>
<p>
  In the mid-1990s, the Apache HTTP Server and Microsoft IIS emerged as popular platforms, offering more robust and customizable features. Around the same time, the concept of application servers took off, with technologies like Java Servlets (1997) allowing for dynamic page generation directly on the server.
</p>
<p>
  By the 2000s, dynamic content was the norm. Apache remained dominant, but Nginx arrived in 2004 with an event-driven model that handled high traffic with minimal resource usage. Application servers also matured, with tools like Apache Tomcat and Microsoft's .NET platform supporting enterprise-grade applications.
</p>
<p>
  In the 2010s, the rise of Node.js introduced a JavaScript-based, event-driven server model that became popular for APIs and real-time applications. Todayâ€™s server infrastructure is influenced by cloud-native trends, with a shift toward modular, scalable microservices.
