    <p class="intro">
  Today’s web and application server technologies are dominated by open-source platforms. As of 2025, Nginx leads in market share due to its efficiency and versatility — it can serve static content and also act as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and cache. Apache, though older, remains popular for its flexibility and plugin-based design, powering around a quarter of the web.
</p>
<p>
  Microsoft IIS is still used in enterprise environments, particularly those using ASP.NET, though it has declined in public-facing usage. Apache Tomcat continues to be a leading choice for Java-based applications, offering a streamlined implementation of servlet and JSP specs.
</p>
<p>
  Node.js represents a more modern approach: instead of configuring a traditional server, developers write custom server logic in JavaScript. Its non-blocking, event-driven design is great for real-time services and APIs.
</p>
<p>
  Looking ahead, trends like containerization (e.g., Docker), serverless computing (e.g., AWS Lambda), and edge computing (e.g., Cloudflare Workers) are reshaping how and where servers operate. These tools increase scalability, reduce latency, and shift processing closer to end users, marking a shift toward distributed and cloud-native server architectures.
